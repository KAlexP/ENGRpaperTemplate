# ENGRpaperTemplate
This is a LaTex template that draws engineering paper on it.

To use the template first modify the python file to have your
name in the python file inplace of NAME.

Next modify the LaTex template to have your name, and other info.

Then run the python script to generate a 
new file that you can modify. Once you have the new LaTex file
modify that document as you wish.
